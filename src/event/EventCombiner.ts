/** ### Combines multiple events to let subscribers listen to any combination of the events

 * #### Detailed overview
 *
 * Consider having `new EventCombiner('myCombiner')` as a prefix for the following method chains:
 *
 * ##### `.all(HANDLERS).then(CALLBACK)`
 * - Calls the given CALLBACK once **all** of the given HANDLERS have dispatched.
 * - After that, every time one of the HANDLERS dispatches, the CALLBACK is called again.
 * - *use this if you want to react to multiple events, that all* **must** *be dispatched once*
 *
 * ##### `.some(HANDLERS).then(CALLBACK)`
 * - Calls the given CALLBACK once **one** of the given HANDLERS has dispatched.
 * - After that, every time one of the HANDLERS dispatches, the CALLBACK is called again.
 * - *use this to react to multiple events without any restriction*
 *
 * ##### `.once().all(HANDLERS).then(CALLBACK)`
 * - Calls the given CALLBACK once **all** of the given HANDLERS have dispatched.
 * - After that, the CALLBACK is never called again, when one of the HANDLERS is dispatched.
 * - *use this if you want to react when a whole set of events has dispatched once*
 *
 * ##### `.once().all(HANDLERS).first().then(CALLBACK)`
 * - Calls the given CALLBACK once **all** of the given HANDLERS have dispatched.
 * - After that, the CALLBACK is never called again, when one of the HANDLERS is dispatched.
 * - Different to once.all just the first occurred event for every handler is provided
 * - *use this if you want to react when a whole set of events has dispatched once*
 *
 * ##### `.once().some(HANDLERS).then(CALLBACK)`
 * - Calls the given CALLBACK once **one** of the given HANDLERS has dispatched.
 * - After that, the CALLBACK is never called again, when one of the HANDLERS is dispatched.
 * - *use this if you want to react if a random event dispatches once*
 *
 * ##### `.consume().all(HANDLERS).then(CALLBACK)`
 * - Calls the given CALLBACK once **all** of the given HANDLERS have dispatched.
 * - After that **all** of the given HANDLERS have to be dispatched once **again** for another CALLBACK call.
 * - *Use this if you want to react to a synchronously repeated occurrence of a whole set of events*
 *
 * ##### `.consume().all(HANDLERS)first().then(CALLBACK)`
 * - Calls the given CALLBACK once **all** of the given HANDLERS have dispatched.
 * - After that **all** of the given HANDLERS have to be dispatched once **again** for another CALLBACK call.
 * - Different to consume.all just the first occurred event for every handler is provided
 * - *Use this if you want to react to a synchronously repeated occurrence of a whole set of events*
 *
 * ##### `.consume().some(HANDLERS).then(CALLBACK)`
 * - Calls the given CALLBACK once **one** of the given HANDLERS has dispatched.
 * - After that, every time one of the HANDLERS dispatches, the CALLBACK is called again.
 * - *use this to react to multiple events with the restriction, that only the last occurred event
 *   has a payload in the CALLBACK*
 *
 * #### `consume()` behavior
 * "consume" can be understood as a consumption of the dispatched events when the callback is called, so
 * `consume()` resets the received events. This means that the payloads provided in the CALLBACK will
 * only be the ones that have been delivered since the last call of the CALLBACK. Therefore `all()`
 * will have all "*fresh*" payloads and `some()` will have only one (the last) payload.
 *
 * Without `consume()` the CALLBACKS will always receive the respectively last payload that has been
 * delivered for every corresponding event - even if the event has dispatched in a previous iteration
 * of the CALLBACK.
 *
 * #### HANDLERS
 * HANDLERS is a list of `EventHandler`s that one would normally subscribe separately to.
 *
 * #### CALLBACK
 * The CALLBACK is a function that provides the dispatched `DomainEvent`s from the given HANDLERS as an array. The order of the DomainEvents
 * in the array correlates to the order of the given HANDLERS from the `all(HANDLERS)` or `some(HANDLERS)` method.
 * The DomainEvents including their payloads are also correctly typed corresponding to their HANDLERS.
 *
 * ##### ATTENTION:
 * Since `some()` means that not all of the HANDLERS have to dispatch, not all of the provided
 * DomainEvents may exist. Therefore the type is `DomainEvent<any> | 'pending'`, where 'pending' means,
 * that the EVENT has not yet been dispatched. This has to be catched when working with the `.some(HANDLERS)` payloads.
