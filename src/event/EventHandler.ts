/** ### A Handler that allows subscribers (any caller) to subscribe to a specific event
 *
 * All subscribers will be notified if the EventHandler dispatched the event.
 *
 * @example
 * At first the EventHandler has to be created with a **unique** name that subscribes the purpose.
 * - the generic can be of any type / interface
 * - to create a handler which only handles "notification" (without payload) the generic has to be `<void>`
 * - the unique name gets relevant when combining EventHandlers with `EventCombiner`s
 *
 * ```ts
 * const StringEventHandler = new EventHandler<string>('StringEventHandler');
 * ```
 *
 * To receive messages from the handler, a subscription has to be made with a **unique** name.
 * - the name of the subscription is relevant when handling multiple subscribers an referencing when unsubscribing
 * - the `event` which is provided in the callback is a `DomainEvent` with the dispatched payload (typed)
 *
 * ```ts
 * StringEventHandler.subscribe('StringEventLogger', (event) => {
 *   console.log(event.payload);
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * To send messages a dispatch with the correctly typed value has to be made.
 *
 * ```ts
 * StringEventHandler.dispatch('my payload'); // StringEventLogger logs 'my payload'
 * ```
 *
 * When a Subscription is unsubscribed, the callback will no longer be called
 *
 * ```ts
 * StringEventHandler.unsubscribe('StringEventLogger');
 * StringEventHandler.dispatch('another payload'); // StringEventLogger is no longer notified
 * ```
 *
 * @Logging
 * To use the logging functionality the handler has to be extended to activate the following logging methods:
 * - `protected logSubscribe(name: string)` - log when `.subscribe()` is called
 * - `protected logUnsubscribe(name: string)` - log when `.unsubscribe()` is called
 * - `protected logDispatch()` - log when `dispatch()` is called
 * - `protected logDispatchedSubscription(subscription: Subscription<Payload>)` - log when a subscription is notified
 *
